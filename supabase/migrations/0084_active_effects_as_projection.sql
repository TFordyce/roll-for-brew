-- spell_active_effects as a deterministic projection of the Cast Log (issue
-- #310, ninth implementation slice of the effect-application rebuild #302 /
-- ADR 0005). Boundary: this slice only touches how active effects are
-- STORED and READ. room_players.modifier as a materialized cache is #311's
-- job -- modifier composition is untouched beyond the active-effect read
-- path.
--
-- Migration number: master's highest is 0077 (0077_cast_log_schema_expand);
-- the rebuild branch adds 0078..0083. This is 0084. Re-check at the
-- integrate step (branching strategy in #303) and renumber to sit after
-- master's current highest.
--
-- What changes
-- ------------
-- 1. spell_active_effects.source_cast_id becomes NOT NULL and its FK flips
--    from ON DELETE SET NULL to ON DELETE CASCADE. Every promoted effect row
--    is now anchored to the Cast Log row that produced it. NULL-source rows
--    today are transient declared_number sentinels (re-castable) and
--    pre-CASCADE orphans from historical round deletes -- rooms are daily so
--    there is no long-lived state to preserve; they are deleted before the
--    constraint is tightened.
--
--    BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: deleting a round (admin_delete_round -> delete from
--    rounds, which cascades to spell_casts) now also deletes that round's
--    promoted spell_active_effects rows. That is the intended semantics:
--    "deleting a cast re-projects its effect away" (#292).
--
-- 2. rounds_remaining stops being a mutable counter. It is now an immutable
--    duration snapshot: the value it was inserted with (spell_cards
--    .duration_rounds, or NULL for an unbounded ward), never decremented.
--    "How many rounds are left" is DERIVED per-round.
--
-- 3. New _rr_active_effects_as_of(room, round): the authoritative row source
--    for "which effects are live as of this round". A row is live iff its
--    source cast is not negated, its duration is not exhausted (counting
--    resolved rounds between the source round and the as-of round), and it
--    has not been dispelled at/before the as-of round. Every reader of
--    spell_active_effects is rewired through it.
--
-- 4. The in-place tick (update rounds_remaining = rounds_remaining - 1;
--    delete where rounds_remaining <= 0) is removed from the legacy 4-arg
--    resolve_round -- the only place it lived. end_active_effect stops
--    physically deleting the row; the dispel is already a logged spell_casts
--    row, which _rr_active_effects_as_of now honours.
--
-- 5. cast_spell_card's declared_number_tea_maker branch inserts its Cast Log
--    row BEFORE the sentinel active-effect row so the latter can carry a
--    real source_cast_id.
--
-- 6. rebuild_active_effects_projection(room): explicit from-scratch rebuild
--    of a room's projection by replaying its Cast Log in seq order. A debug
--    / maintenance op only -- the steady-state path stays incremental.
--
-- No src/ code reads spell_active_effects directly; every RPC signature and
-- output column below is unchanged, so there is no TypeScript type churn.

-- ===========================================================================
-- 1. Schema: source_cast_id NOT NULL + ON DELETE CASCADE; rounds_remaining
--    redefined as an immutable snapshot.
-- ===========================================================================

-- Drop rows with no Cast Log anchor: transient declared_number sentinels and
-- pre-CASCADE orphans. Safe -- rooms are daily, nothing here outlives a day.
delete from public.spell_active_effects where source_cast_id is null;

alter table public.spell_active_effects
  drop constraint if exists spell_active_effects_source_cast_id_fkey;

alter table public.spell_active_effects
  add constraint spell_active_effects_source_cast_id_fkey

comment on column public.spell_active_effects.rounds_remaining is
  'Issue #310: immutable duration snapshot (spell_cards.duration_rounds at '
  'promotion time; NULL = unbounded ward). Never decremented -- how many '
  'rounds remain is derived by _rr_active_effects_as_of from the count of '
  'resolved rounds since the source cast.';

comment on column public.spell_active_effects.source_cast_id is
  'Issue #310: NOT NULL. The Cast Log row this effect was promoted from. '
  'ON DELETE CASCADE -- deleting the cast (or its round) re-projects the '

-- ===========================================================================
-- 2. _rr_active_effects_as_of(room, round) -- the projection row source.
-- ===========================================================================
-- Returns the spell_active_effects rows that are LIVE as of p_as_of_round_id.
-- Drop-in for `from public.spell_active_effects sae` in any reader that has a
-- room id and a round id in scope (it returns `setof
-- public.spell_active_effects`, so every sae.<col> reference still resolves).
--
-- A row is live as of the given round iff ALL of:
--   * its source cast is not negated (negating the originating cast
--     re-projects the effect away -- #310 AC);
--   * its duration is not exhausted: rounds_remaining IS NULL (unbounded), OR
--     the number of resolved rounds in [source-cast's round .started_at,
--     as-of round .started_at) is < rounds_remaining. The as-of bound is
--     strict so a D=N effect cast in round R is live for rounds R .. R+N-1
--     regardless of whether it is queried before or after round R resolves
--     (Caffeine Crash D=2 cast in round 1 -> live rounds 1,2; gone round 3).
--   * it has not been dispelled at or before the as-of round: no non-negated
--     'dispel' cast whose effect_params.ended_effect_id names this row sits
--     in a round started on/before the as-of round. (<= so a pre-roll dispel
--     in round Rd removes the effect from Rd onward; earlier rounds still
--     show it -- more faithful than the old immediate physical DELETE.)
--
-- A NULL / unknown p_as_of_round_id yields no as-of started_at, so the
-- duration count is 0 and no dispel matches -> every non-negated row is
-- returned. Real callers always pass a real round; get_room_active_effects
-- in an empty room hits this and correctly shows full duration.
