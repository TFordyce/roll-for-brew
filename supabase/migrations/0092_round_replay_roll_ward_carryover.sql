-- Round replay: roll-domain ward carry-over + roll_frozen Trace step
-- (issue #351, spec #302 §11 acceptance criterion, ADR 0005). Rider on
-- issue #315 / migration 0090 (Round replay -- Time for Brew), carved out of
-- that slice's "core only" scope.
--
-- Spec #302 §11 AC: "A roll-domain-ward holder does not re-roll in
-- generation 1; a `roll-frozen` Trace step appears." (The Trace step's
-- display_kind is spelled `roll_frozen`, snake_case like every sibling kind.)
--
-- Per-holder roll-domain ward carry-over on scrap:
--   * When a resolved round is scrapped for replay (confirm_round_replay ->
--     _rr_scrap_round), a participant who holds an ACTIVE NEGATIVE-polarity
--     roll-domain ward -- spell_active_effects.effect_kind = 'ward' with
--     'roll' in effect_params.domain AND 'negative' in effect_params.polarity
--     -- keeps their generation-0 layer-0 roll instead of re-rolling. The
--     carry-over is flat: polarity gates WHICH wards trigger it, but a
--     triggering ward always freezes the roll regardless of whether a
--     re-roll would have helped.
--   * Everyone else rolls fresh in generation 1 (unchanged from 0090).
--   * Card mapping (spell_card_effects, migration 0082):
--       - Cast-Iron Kettle  polarity {negative}, domain {modifier, roll}
--         -> the charter case, and the only current card that triggers.
--       - Jinxed Biscuit     polarity {positive}, domain {modifier, roll}
--         -> roll-domain but positive -> NO carry-over (spec: "Jinxed
--         Biscuit: no interaction"). This is why polarity is in the filter,
--         not just domain (decision: Tom, 2026-09-02).
--       - Bag for Life / Eternal Steep  domain {modifier} only -> no
--         carry-over.
--   * generation-1 resolve_round(uuid) emits a `roll_frozen` Trace step on
--     the carried-over player's own row (before === after -- it never moves
--     the composed value). Gated on replay_generation > 0 -- generation-0
--     rounds resolve byte-identically to 0089.
--
-- Ward lookup shares _rr_active_effects_as_of (issue #310) -- the same
-- projection the resolver's ward phase (#309) reads. Computed inside
-- _rr_scrap_round BEFORE its spell_casts delete, so a ward cast in the very
-- round being scrapped still counts.
--
-- KNOWN TRADEOFF: the retained roll keeps its generation-0 rolls.modifier_
-- snapshot verbatim (spec wording: "keeps their generation-0 layer-0 roll").
-- _rr_scrap_round recomputes room_players.modifier for affected players, but
-- the frozen roll's own snapshot is not refreshed, so a frozen roller can
-- resolve generation 1 on a slightly stale modifier base. Cast-Iron Kettle
-- also wards the modifier domain (negative), so negative modifier effects on
-- the holder are filtered in gen-1 Phase 4a anyway; a full snapshot refresh
-- is left for the #352 retention follow-up.
--
-- MIGRATION NUMBER: 0092. 0091 was claimed first by issue #352's
-- 0091_get_round_recap_scrapped_generations.sql (PR #354, also into
-- rebuild/effect-resolver); per the recorded convention the second slice
-- renumbers, so this is 0092. #352 also edits src/lib/game/roundRecap.ts,
-- roundRecap.test.ts, RoundRecap.tsx and tests/integration/round-replay.test.ts
-- -- expect merge conflicts in those files too; whoever merges second
-- resolves. Recheck all rebuild-branch migration numbers at the #303
-- integrate gate regardless.

  --
  -- Spec §6 numbers this "4b" (adjacent to modifier composition), but it is
  -- coded here, after Phase 4c: the persistent rest-of-day delta is
  -- independent of the round-composed modifier and of 4c's in-place lift of
  -- v_composed, so ordering relative to 4a/4c is immaterial and running last
  -- avoids interleaving with the composed-array walk.
  --
  -- For every player targeted by a non-negated persistent_modifier_transfer
  -- or persistent_modifier_spend cast in THIS round, set the materialized
  -- room_players.modifier cache to base + rest-of-day spell delta and emit one
  -- Trace step per cast with a deterministic running before -> after. Players
  -- not touched by a transfer this round keep their existing modifier -- every
  -- non-spell writer (brewer gain, adjustments, admin tools) and Kettle
  -- Crash's imperative reset stay authoritative for them.
  --
  -- The recompute is absolute (base + full delta), so re-running resolve_round
  -- over the same inputs reproduces the same room_players.modifier and the
  -- same steps. The per-step `before` is derived from base + the delta of
  -- earlier-seq matching casts, never from the live room_players.modifier, so
  -- it does not drift on a second run.
  --
  -- ADR 0005 note: a transfer's `delta` is a cast-time snapshot of a mutable
  -- room_players.modifier (WILD branch 3/5 -- see cast_spell_card). The value
  -- is recorded in the Cast Log, so a replay reproduces it; the swap outcome
  -- is path-dependent on cast timing, the same grudging exception the ADR
  -- grants the eager shim. Within this slice only one snapshot-taking cast per
  -- round is reachable (a single Wild Brew Surge instance in the deck), so no
  -- same-round transfer reads another's not-yet-projected delta.

  -- Phase 4b-pre (issue #342): Bitter Leech per-round tick synthesis.

  -- +per_round_delta persistent_modifier_transfer pair into THIS round's Cast
  -- Log -- the target loses, the caster gains. The pair then flows through the
  -- ordinary Phase 4b projection and _rr_spell_modifier_delta /
  -- get_modifier_breakdown exactly like a Chai-nge / WILD transfer, so the
  -- breakdown reconciles for free. Written once per (round, source cast): a
  -- re-resolve finds the tick already present and skips the insert, and the
  -- absolute recompute below reproduces the same room_players.modifier.
